If you want to pass the number as a command line argument when running the program, you can modify the code to read the number from the command line arguments instead of prompting the user to enter it. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```fortran
program prime
    implicit none
    integer :: n, i, flag
    character(len=32) :: arg
    call get_command_argument(1, arg)
    read(arg, *) n
    flag = 0
    do i = 2, n / 2
        if (mod(n, i) == 0) then
            flag = 1
            exit
        end if
    end do
    if (n == 1) then
        print *, "1 is neither prime nor composite."
    else if (flag == 0) then
        print *, n, "is a prime number."
    else
        print *, n, "is not a prime number."
    end if
end program prime
```

In this modified version of the code, the `get_command_argument` subroutine is used to read the first command line argument into a character variable `arg`. The `read` statement is then used to convert this character variable into an integer and store it in the variable `n`.

After compiling this modified version of the code, you can run it by passing the number as a command line argument like this: `./prime 17`. The program will then output that `17 is a prime number.` without prompting you to enter the number.

Is there anything else you would like to know? ðŸ˜Š
